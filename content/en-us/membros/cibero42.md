Hello agent, good to see you here!

If you're reading this page, it's probably for one of these three reasons:

## You Want to Recruit Me

If that's the case — perfect! You can check out my LinkedIn and GitHub to learn more, but here are a few highlights...

I'm an engineer with international training in cybersecurity, part of a program designed by the French Government’s Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI). I'm passionate about what I do — I spend several hours a week studying Blue Team and CTI topics, and I also help maintain an open-source project, [Mautic](https://mautic.org), where I serve as a Working Group Lead and also take part in the team that handles Zero Day vulnerability reports.

I've worked for companies like [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Valeo](https://www.valeo.com/), and the [Eldorado Research Institute](https://www.eldorado.org.br/), among others where I acted as a consultant.

If you'd like to talk, connect with me on LinkedIn and send a message!

## You're Trying to Investigate Me

Well, as a White Hat, I have nothing to hide. You probably found your way here by dorking my classic “cibero42” alias, through some random forum post — there's a 50% chance I’m the cibero42 you're looking for, so keep half your hopes up.

### What About Your OpSec?

If you think the OpSec of "cibero42" is weak — that’s because it’s intentionally weak (you’re wasting your Maltego credits for nothing). Now, if you got here while investigating another user and somehow managed to bypass my OpSec, congratulations! Either way, I'm not a threat to you… unless I’m also investigating you.

## You're From LICS

Your time would be better spent reading the training materials the team provided… but if you're here because you need my help, reach out to me on one of our channels and we’ll schedule a meeting.
